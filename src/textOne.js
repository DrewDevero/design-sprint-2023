                <h2>The Importance of Connection</h2>
                <p>
                Throughout the years we have been losing human connection, technology might be a huge contributor as its advancements have been harmful to human communication. This is ironic to say because technology has made it possible to communicate with anyone anywhere at any time, but this is all digital. True human connection is vital to our mental healths. We, humans, need intimate conversation, eye contact, and empathy from friends and family.

                <h2>Coming Back to the Table</h2>
                <p>
                Back were the days when families would have dinner together on the dining table everyday and actually interact, in the past 20 years, the frequency of family dinners has declined 33 percent. Family Dinner was important, It was valuable for deepening family connection, hearing about each other’s days, and enjoying some quiet time together. But this is rare now, people have accustomed to door dashing their dinner, and eating separately, which is comforting at times but not the most beneficial.

                There were many benefits to family dinners, not only nutritionally with healthier statistics but also emotionally and mentally. Children that frequently participated in family dinners performed better academically, engaged less in risky behavior and had an overall better relationship with their parents. More frequent family dinners are related to fewer emotional and behavioral problems, greater emotional well-being, more trusting and helpful behaviors towards others and higher life satisfaction.
